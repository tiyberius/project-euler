Project Euler solutions
=======================

This project contains Python code to solve a few of the problems from the
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about). If you would like to run this code on your
machine, you can do the following:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tiyberius/project-euler.git
    $ cd project-euler
    $ mkvirtualenv project-euler
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python solve_problems.py  # wouldn't it be nice if real life worked this way

Sample output from `solve_problems.py`
